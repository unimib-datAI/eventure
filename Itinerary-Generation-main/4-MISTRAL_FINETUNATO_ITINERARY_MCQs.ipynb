Today, it serves as a cultural centre and it is home to international art exhibitions. It spans through an area of 7,000 square meters and it regularly hosts modern and contemporary art works and famous collections in cooperation with notable museums and cultural institutions from across the world. More than 1,500 masterpieces are on display annually. It was originally designed to include two courtyards but these were later dismantled to make room for the Duomo. The Palazzo is located to the right of the Duomo's facade, opposite to Galleria Vittorio Emanuele II. The facade of the Palazzo creates a recess in Piazza del Duomo which functions as a courtyard, known as the Piazzetta Reale (literally, a \"Small Royal Square\"). The famous Hall of Caryatids can be found on the main floor of the building, heavily damaged by World War II's air raids.After the war the Palazzo remained abandoned for over two years and its condition further deteriorated. Many of the Palazzo's neoclassical interiors were lost in this period.\n","\n","GENERATE THE QUESTION AND THE ANSWER BASED ONLY ON THE PROVIDED INFORMATION.\n","### OUTPUT FORMAT:\n","Your response must follow this exact structure:\n","Q: [Write a clear, engaging question about Royal Palace of Milan based on above abstract and information]\n","A) * [Correct answer]\n","B) [Incorrect answer]\n","C) [Incorrect answer]\n","-------------------------------\n","Fact: [One interesting fact about Royal Palace of Milan based on the provided information]\n","\n","### REQUIREMENTS:\n","1.
